# ``cfmult``

A quick tool that wraps ``crazyflie_tools`` to do things for a group of Crazyflies. To
get this thing working for your repo, copy this folder somewhere in `$PATH` like 
`~/.local/custom/cfmult` and create a symbolic link somewhere on the PATH. On unix, you 
can do something like:
```bash
    ln -s ~/.local/lib/custom/cfmult/_cfmult.py ~/.local/bin/cfmult
```
